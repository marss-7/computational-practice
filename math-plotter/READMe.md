# Function Plotter

A beginner-level Python script that plots a mathematical function based on user input.

## What It Does

- Asks the user to choose between:
  - `sin(x) * x`
  - `cos(x)`
- Lets the user define the x-range (`xmin` and `xmax`)
- Plots the selected function using matplotlib
- Saves the plot as a PNG image in the same folder
